 <h1>Web Technologies</h1>
 <p>   Web technology forms the backbone of everything we experience online today. From navigating websites to interacting with complex web applications, these technologies are the driving force behind the digital world. As the internet continues to evolve, understanding the technologies that power it has become increasingly important....</p>
 <p>The scope of web technology has expanded to include cutting-edge functionalities like real-time communication, artificial intelligence (AI), and decentralized networks. </p>
 <h2>Essential Tools</h2>
 <ul type="desc">

 </ul>
 <h3><I>HTML (HyperText Markup Language):</I></h3>
 <p>  HTML is the foundational markup language of the web. It defines the structure of web pages by specifying elements such as <I>headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and links</I>. HTML acts as the starting point for any website or web application.</p>
 <h3><I>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</I></h3>
 <p>   While HTML defines the structure, CSS is responsible for the appearance. <I>It controls the design, including colors, fonts, layout, and responsiveness, ensuring that websites look good across various devices and screen sizes.</I></p>
 <h3><I>JavaScript:</I></h3>
 <p>  JavaScript is a programming language that adds interacti vity to websites. <I>It enables dynamic content, such as clickable buttons, animations, and real-time form validation. JavaScript is often used alongside HTML and CSS to create seamless user experiences.</I></p>
 <h3>Web Browsers:</h3>
 <p>Browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari interpret HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and render websites on usersâ€™ devices. They play a crucial role in ensuring a smooth user experience.</p>
 <h3><I>Web Servers:</I></h3>
 <p> Web servers host websites and serve content over the internet. They store files and data that make up a website and deliver them to users when requested. Web servers use protocols like HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (HTTP Secure) to communicate with browsers.</p>
 <h3><I>Web Protocols:</I></h3>
 <p>Web Protocols: Protocols are the rules that govern communication between web servers and browsers. HTTP is the most common protocol, but HTTPS, which encrypts data for security, is becoming more prevalent. Newer protocols like HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 offer faster and more efficient communication.</p>
 <h3><I>APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):</I></h3>
 <p> APIs are essential for modern web applications. They allow different software systems to communicate with each other. <b>For example :</b> A weather website may use an API to fetch real-time data from a third-party weather service.</p>
 <h3><I>Databases:</I></h3>
 <p>Databases store and manage data for websites and applications. They allow for efficient storage, retrieval, and updating of data. Examples of databases used in web technology include <I>MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL.</I></p>
